# 1.1 Intro to Proofs

**discrete** - branch of mathematics that works with numbers or data that is not continuous.

## Proofs 

Ability to distiguish an argument that may not be completely correct, from an argument that is 100% correct.

### Definitions

<dl>
    <dt>Proposition</dt>
    <dd>A statement that is either true or false</dd>
    <dt>Predicate</dt>
    <dd>A proposition whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables.</dd>
    <dt>Axiom</dt>
    <dd>A proposition that is simply accepted as true.</dd>
    <dt>Proof</dt>
    <dd>A sequence of logical deductions from axioms and previously proved statements that concludes with the proposition in question.</dd>
    <dt>Theorem</dt>
    <dd>An important true proposition.</dd>
    <dt>Lemma</dt>
    <dd>A preliminary proposition useful for proving later propositions.</dd>
    <dt>Corollary</dt>
    <dd>A proposigtion that follows in just a few logical steps from a theorem.</dd>       
</dl>

### Implication

IF _P_, THEN _Q_ - the general form of an **implication** and is often written as _P_ IMPLIES _Q_. Thus, given specific _P_ and _Q_, _P_ IMPLIES _Q_ is itself a proposition and can either be true or false.

### Pythagorean theorem

If I have a right triangle with sides a, b, and hypotenuse c, then a^2 * b^2 = c^2.

- complementary angles of a right angle sum to 180

### Proof by Contradiction

If an assertion implies something **false**, then the assertion itself must be **false**.

### Proof by Cases

Reasoning by cases breaks a complicated problem into easier subproblems (used by intuitionists).
